# zynthian-surge.lv2

This is a bundle containing the surge synthesizer compiled as LV2 for ARM.
Also includes the needed data files and some LV2 presets converted from the surge library.
The bundle is mainly thought for installing on zynthian as a "experimental" engine until a fully working version is available on repositories.
